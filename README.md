## Result
Graph between sentiment polarity score and time series which represents Modi’s sentiments time line with sliding window of mean, lower threshold and upper threshold over 90 days of tweeter data computations. Change points are shown by circles which are determined by deviation from mean and SD of that moving window and signified by the sudden change in the sentiment score of an entity.
Furthermore, Change point from tweets of BJP group is computed in the graph between sentiments score and 90 days periods of time series data from tweeters timeline of the group By using this data, we can mine and analyses this data for various decision making and prediction purposes.
